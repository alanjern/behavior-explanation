38,3,3,7,4,3,7,2,3,3,2,2,7,7,3,2,David seems to be hedging his bets by picking the middle.  So not knowing where they would be or anything with the clown being on B would be highly likely.  Anything deliberately placing the clown on A or B are very unlikely.  Anything where the clown is placed at A or C by chance is unlikely

46,1,5,2,7,7,4,2,1,4,7,6,4,4,2,1,It makes sense to sit right in front of stage c if he likes clowns and believes that the clown will perform on stage c. It makes sense to sit closest to the stage of the performer that he wants to see most. 
46,2,4,5,6,2,6,3,1,1,7,7,7,7,2,2,It would make sense to sit in the seat that Matt chose if he believed the clown would perform on either b or c because that way he can see the clown perform and a little bit of the other performances too. 
46,3,3,4,3,2,7,3,3,3,3,4,7,7,3,4,IF Alex likes to see the clowns and is indifferent to the other performers than he should sit in front of B if he believes the clown will perform on stage b. Then he can also see the other performers at the same time and get to see a little of everything.
