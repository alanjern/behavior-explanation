Experiment 3 analysis code
===========================

* `analyzedata.R`: finds the best-fitting parameter for each condition (likes clowns and dislikes clowns) for each model. It then generates scatter plots comparing model predictions for each model to the mean ratings for each explanation.
* `analyzedata_noexclusions.R`: does the same thing but does not exclude any data.
