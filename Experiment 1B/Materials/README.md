Experiment 1B materials
=======================

Unfortunately, the exact code used to run Experiment 1B was lost. 

However, the design of Experiment 1B was nearly identical to Experiment 1A. The only difference is that subjects did not rate the 13 explanations. Instead, they were asked to provide their best explanation for why the person chose to sit where they did. They wrote their explanation in a text box.

The file `example_case.png` contains the example that subjects were shown at the beginning of the experiment.
