`rawdata_v2.csv` contains subjects' ratings from the version of the experiment depicted below, in which subjects saw a mirror image of what subjects in Version 1 saw.

* Condition 1: ![X sat closest to A](../Materials/images/condition1_v2.png)
* Condition 2: ![X sat between A and B](../Materials/images/condition1_v2.png)
* Condition 3: ![X sat between A and B](../Materials/images/condition1_v2.png)

The columns use the following naming convention: `judgment_X_Y`, where `X` refers to the condition (denoted above) and `Y` denotes the explanation being rated. There are also a set of `chk` judgments from an attention check page.
