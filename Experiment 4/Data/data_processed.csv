4,food allergy,didn't eat,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,1,He should know which foods contain benzatrate and he should always known for a fact whether a food contains it before he eats it.
9,food allergy,didn't eat,4,5,3,4,4,4,4,4,I went with my gut feeling on that
18,food allergy,didn't eat,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,Matt may or may not have known that the foods contained benzatrate. He may have simply chosen not to eat these foods. 
23,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,He might have prior knowledge of what foods contain it due to the fact that he has the allergy.
27,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"All three ingredients contained benzatrate which means he was allergic to all 3, so any of the foods that he didn't eat provided a good explanation for why he didn't eat the appetizer, as they all would have made him sick. "
33,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,3,5,2,7,2,"alex knew goat cheese bell pepper,and bacan contained benzatrate"
34,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,ALEX WANTED TO AVOID EATING FOOD CONTAINING BENZATRATE
40,food allergy,didn't eat,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,4,"David probably knows what foods have benzatrate. It is possible, though, that he just didn't like any of the foods and accidentally avoided the benzatrate."
41,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,All three of the ingredients contained benzatrate 
44,food allergy,didn't eat,6,5,3,5,4,5,4,3,I think Jacob had some idea
48,food allergy,didn't eat,4,6,5,5,6,3,6,4,just looked right
52,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3," If he's allergic to it, it makes sense that he would know, and would avoid it. I guess this scenario you didn't specify that he already knew that he was allergic to it, but it seems odd to me that someone wouldn't know they are allergic to something that is in common foods."
56,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Alex is aware of her allergic condition and what foods not to eat this is the most logical reason to my answers.
57,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,If Matt was severely allergic he should have known that the foods presented would contain benzatrate.
58,food allergy,didn't eat,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,Anyone severely allergic to anything would be very informed about what to avoid.
60,food allergy,didn't eat,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,knowing is good explanation
61,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"Any of the explanations that note that Alex was aware of the ingredient benzatrate being in the food was a satisfying explanation to me. Because Alex knows that he is allergic to benzatrate, it makes very good sense that he would not eat an appetizer which includes food that is known to contain benzatrate in it."
62,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,"He either actively avoided the food as many people with allergies do, or he just wasnt hungry. "
73,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,As Matt has allergic problems to benzatrate and after he knows that the apetizer served at the party has it it will be wise if he avoids those and he rightly did.
76,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,I think that the fact that he avoided it even if he didn't know is kind of acceptable but should be improved upon but the other instances are perfect as he has knowledge of the contents of each ingredient but he needs to improve this knowledge.
79,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Matt decided not to eat the food because he knew he was allergic to a chemical in the ingredients.
80,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Any explanation where Matt knew the allergen would give an equally valid and strong reason. 
86,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,David knows about his allergy so he must know what foods he can or cannot eat.
88,food allergy,didn't eat,5,5,4,4,5,4,5,4,I think Matt did the best he could given what he could reasonably tell 
94,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,It makes sense for him not to eat the appetizer that contained benzatrate in all the ingredients as he was probably well aware. 
96,food allergy,didn't eat,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,alex is probably knowledgeable about what foods potentially contain the additive that he is allergic to
103,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Jacob knew that all of the appetizers had benzatrate and he knew he was allergic to it.
109,food allergy,didn't eat,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,1,"If David knew all the food had benzatrate, then not eating any of it makes sense. If he knew only one or two of the foods had benzatrate , then it doesn't explain why he didn't eat the remaining food(s). If he didn't know any of them had benzatrate, then no reason is given for why he didn't eat the foods."
118,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"it doesn't matter if he knew whether 1,2 or 3 ingredients contained benzatrate - he'd still be severely allergic. The last answer doesn't provide an explanation."
123,food allergy,didn't eat,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,"When you have allergies you need to know what foods do what, so he knew based on knowledge."
126,food allergy,didn't eat,5,5,5,5,5,6,5,2,"A person who is suffering from some kind of severe allergy has a tendency to know what kind of things could start off symptoms for that allergy, so jacob would have already researched on what foods contain benzatrate."
141,food allergy,didn't eat,5,7,6,3,3,2,5,3,Alex thought the food smelled bad
144,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,3,"If she knew at least one of the ingredients contained benzatrate, that was enough to warrant her not eating the dish."
145,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,If Alex knows that at least one of the ingredients of the appetizer contains the additive that triggers his allergic reaction then he will not eat it.
158,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"Jacob would probably educate himself on benzatrate since he is allergic, it's common, and most other people probably can't tell him what it is found in."
161,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"If David knew that any of the ingredients contained benzatrate, that would be a very good explanation for his behavior."
162,food allergy,didn't eat,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,i feel like he would know that these products had these things in it and would avoid them.
163,food allergy,didn't eat,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,"If he's severely allergic, he should know. "
170,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,if he knew he wouldn't eat it
171,food allergy,didn't eat,4,4,5,4,5,6,4,1,"I wasn't sure if he knew or didn't know that the food items contained benzatrate. So, for some of the answers, I gave a rating of ""4."" For some of the other answers, they sounded pretty good as being a good explanation for why he didn't eat the appetizer. So, I gave those a rating of ""5"" or higher. And for the ones that were not good explanations, I gave them lower scores."
172,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,6,6,6,5,2,"Since Jacob is severely allergic to benzatrate, he would probably be aware of what foods contain the additive. It's more likely he'd be aware of the additive in one food than in all three."
177,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"Since all of the ingredients contained benzatrate, the fact that Jacob knew any 1 of the ingredients contained benzatrate is an excellent reason for him not eating the appetizer."
179,food allergy,didn't eat,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,1,"David won't eat the appetizer if either of the 3 dishes contain benzatrate. So, I went with statements with closeness to this."
184,food allergy,didn't eat,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,I have no sure way of knowing that David knew.
185,food allergy,didn't eat,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,what does benzatrate even mean? matt didnt explain it
186,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"If he knew about it, obviously he wouldn't eat it."

0,food allergy,ate,1,1,1,3,3,3,7,1,"It's obvious that Matt knew that whichever ingredient is not mentioned under ""didn't know"" list contains benzatrate. Say, he didn't know about 2 of 3 - maybe he thought that the volume of b. in the ingredient he knew about won't be enough to cause a severe onset of allergy. But if he didn't know about 1 of 3, it means he knew that 2 of 3 for sure contain b., and it's too careless then.to eat that appetizer. "
2,food allergy,ate,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,2,Matt woldn't have consumed the appetiser if he was aware that it contained benzatrate.
3,food allergy,ate,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,1,"If he's allergic to the substance, I think it's imperative for him to know what foods contain it so he doesn't accidentally ingest it."
11,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"All those reasons were good ones, because any one would have had an effect. EXCEPT the last one. He did not know any contained it."
12,food allergy,ate,4,6,5,5,5,5,4,2,"Matt didn't know that the goat cheese contained benzatrate,and also he don't know that the bacon contained benzatrate and also he didn't know that the bell pepper contained benzatrate."
24,food allergy,ate,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,"I rated all of them at 3 because I think that if someone is allergic to something, they should be very aware of what foods contain the ingredient they are allergic too. The only one I rated as 1 was that he knew, that is a very bad explanation because it doesn't make sense for him to eat it if he knows it contains benzatrate."
25,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Alex would not cause himself to get allergies.
28,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"Since he's allergic, the only way he could have eaten the appetizer is by not knowing that it contained benzatrate"
32,food allergy,ate,7,7,5,7,7,5,7,1,if he had known he would not have ate them 
35,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"It is a very good explanation that he didn't know the ingredients in the foods he ate, It is a bad explanation that he knew because he wouldn't have ate it if he knew"
39,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,if he knows hes allergic the only logical explanation is he had no idea the food contained the allergin
42,food allergy,ate,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,"If he's allergic to it, he should know what foods it is in. However, why would he intentionally hurt himself."
43,food allergy,ate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"If this is a common food additive and he is allergic to it, he will know what foods commonly contain this additive.  Ignorance is not a valid excuse when it comes to food allergies."
54,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"matt didnt know that the products contain benzatrate, other wise he would not have eaten it."
59,food allergy,ate,2,4,2,4,2,4,2,2,I think it would be very unreasonable for Matt to not know that any of the products aside from bell pepper contain something he is allergic to as they are very common.
65,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"If he knew at least one contained it, he would not have eaten the appetizer. "
66,food allergy,ate,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,He must be sure of all three to be willing to eat. So only knowing all three was a good explanation
67,food allergy,ate,4,4,4,7,7,7,7,1,He wouldn't have eaten the allergens if he'd known they were there.  It really doesn't matter how you word it.  
69,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"He could have easily not known about all three, but if he KNEW about it, that wouldn't make sense."
70,food allergy,ate,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,"I gave him 4's for when he didn't  know, because he should have asked until he did know so it's not really a good explanation.  I gave him a 1 for when he did know, because he shouldn't have eaten it then."
75,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,It doesn't make any sense that he would eat the appetizer if he knew any of the ingredients contained benzatrate. It makes more sense if he didn't know that any single one of the ingredients contained benzatrate.
81,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"If Jacob knew that these food items contained benzatrate, he would not have eaten them."
82,food allergy,ate,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,"If he is severely allergic he should know all of these things, or should have the common sense to find out before eating."
91,food allergy,ate,5,5,5,5,5,5,7,1,He would not have eaten it if he had known 
92,food allergy,ate,2,2,2,3,3,3,7,1,Since all of the food items contained benzatrate an explanation would have to contain the fact that all three of them had this additive. Listing just one or two is a bad explanation. 
95,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Jacob obviously didn't know that benzatrate was in the appetizer at all.
99,food allergy,ate,3,3,3,3,3,4,1,1,"If he knows he has this allergy, he needs to be knowledgeable about what foods he's allergic to. All 3 food items contain it, so at least 1 of the 3 should have alerted him that he shouldn't eat the food. In reality, he should know all 3 are allergens."
104,food allergy,ate,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,"If David knew that the foods contained benzatrate, it would be a very bad explanation of why he ate the foods. If he didn't know, it would be a good explanation, but he should have asked about the ingredients, or have more knowledge of what types of foods contain the additive."
110,food allergy,ate,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,"I can understand it if he didn't know any of the ingredients had benzatrate, but if he knew even one of them did why would he eat the dish anyway?"
112,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Alex would have only eaten the food not knowing it contained the additive he is allergic to.
115,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"If he didn't know the food contained benzatrate, then it's understandable that he would eat it."
117,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,"If he didn't know, then eating it was not a bad idea if he felt like it."
124,food allergy,ate,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,The only good explanation would be that Jacob wasn't aware of the food additive in the appetizer at all. Picking and choosing implies that he was aware of benzatrate in some of the food.
125,food allergy,ate,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,1,Alex wouldn't eat the appetizers if they had food additives that dangerous to Alex.
127,food allergy,ate,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,David wouldn't have eaten any of them if eh knew they had benzatrate.
128,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,6,6,6,5,1,I think it's unlikely that Jacob didn't know any of them contained benzatrate. It is more likely that he didn't know a couple of the items contained this ingredient. It's very unlikely that he ate it knowing they all contained it.
130,food allergy,ate,4,4,4,4,5,5,4,4,I just did hat
131,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,I figured David would not eat something knowing that he was allergic to it.
134,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,I don't think he knew what the ingredients were that was in the appetizer because he ate them. I do not think he would have put himself at risk like that if he had known what was in the appetizers.
135,food allergy,ate,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,1,given that he is severely allergic to bebzatrate I dont think he would knowingly eat an appetizer containing so much of it
136,food allergy,ate,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,1,I'm assupming david didn't know that they were made from benzatrate therefore he ate them.
138,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,He ate the food only because he didn't know any component contained benzatrate.
154,food allergy,ate,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,He didn't know that all of them contained denzatrate or else he would have not eaten it.  So anything where it says he didn't know is true
155,food allergy,ate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,He knew at least one had benzatrate i all circumstances so no reason to eat it was just
164,food allergy,ate,4,5,5,3,5,4,3,4,I think Alex was unaware of what he was doing.
167,food allergy,ate,2,2,2,3,3,3,6,1,He should have only eaten it if he didn't know it was in all three items
173,food allergy,ate,6,5,6,5,5,4,5,1,It is likely David did not know what was in the appetizers
175,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,why would he be that stupid if he knew it would cause a reaction unless he was wanting a pitty party
176,food allergy,ate,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,1,The only explanation that works is when matt didn't know all three ingredients contained benzatrate. If he knew of even one it is idiotic for him to eat the appetizer
178,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,He didnt know so almost all the sentences make perfect sense
181,food allergy,ate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"Matt should have known to ask before eating, and when in question don't eat it! "

0,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"Each of these crimes is enough to arrest David, so it doesn't matter whether the officer knows about all three robberies, only two of them, or only one of them."
2,robbery,arrested,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,2,Officer must have assumed that Robert could be only culprit by his experience.
3,robbery,arrested,4,4,4,5,5,5,7,1,The officer would have to have been at one of the places to see at least one of the crimes committed.  I would assume that if he were at more than one venue he would positively conclude that Matt is the serial robber.
11,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,Any one of these could have had him arrested. Even the last. He could have don something else.

39,robbery,arrested,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,if david was arrested its a pretty good bet the police had a good suspicion he committed the robberies. they couldnt be 100% sure but sure enough to arrest him

75,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,He would be arrested for doing any one of those robberies so if the police officer knew he did any of them he could be arrested. He could also be arrested if the police officer assigned to the cases caught him doing anything else illegal so I think the police officer not knowing he committed those robberies is also a valid explanation.

92,robbery,arrested,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,1,The best explanation was that the officer was satisfied that David was arrested because he had robbed all three businesses. 
95,robbery,arrested,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,1,"He was assigned to the cases, so probably knew Matt had robbed one of the 3 places, if not all, because of video or witness descriptions or other evidence."
99,robbery,arrested,6,6,5,7,7,6,7,1,Knowing that Alex had robbed at least 1 store is a good explanation for arresting him. Knowing multiple or all 3 is a very good reason.
104,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"If the officer knew and had evidence of Alex committing the crimes, then those were very good explanations. If the officer didn't know or had no evidence, then it was a very bad explanation."

124,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"In every case where the officer knew that Matt had committed a crime it is a very good explanation for arrest. In the option where the officer isn't aware of the robberies being committed by Matt there could still be another reason for his arrest, but it isn't a good explanation. "

128,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,I think it makes sense that Matt would be arrested if the office knew he had robbed any of the businesses. He would not have been arrested if the officer didn't know he had committed any robberies.

134,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,They obviously had video footage or some other type of evidence that pointed towards Jacob and so the officer did his job by arresting Jacob.
135,robbery,arrested,6,6,5,7,7,6,7,1,the police were obviously aware of some or all of his crimes that is why he got arrested 
136,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,The officer knew that Alex committed the three robberies. Very tricky these ones are.
138,robbery,arrested,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,"The officer shouldn't know, but rather suspect, that he robbed the places since he should be innocent until proven guilty."
154,robbery,arrested,3,4,4,4,3,4,4,1,"On this one, the officer knows that he did ONE of the crimes.  He may know that he did all of the crimes, but to arrest Matt, he only needs to know about one of them.  So it's possible he knows of the others but not 100% sure."
155,robbery,arrested,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,2,The more reason the police had makes it a better reason to arrest him
164,robbery,arrested,5,6,3,3,5,4,4,4,I feel like Matt deserves what was coming to him.
167,robbery,arrested,4,4,5,5,5,5,6,1,Knowing he committed all three robberies is the best explanation for arresting him
173,robbery,arrested,4,5,4,4,5,4,5,4,I think that if the police knew he had robbed more than one place it is likely he robbed all three. 
175,robbery,arrested,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,he knew he robbed something one or all does not matter when arresting
176,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,1,"If the officer new that david committed either just one or all three robberies, the arrest was justified and a good enough explanation. If the officer didn't know about the robberies, then the arrest makes zero sense."

27,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"Since Alex was not arrested and all three robberies are arrestable offenses, I would say that the officer didn't know that he had solved any of the three stores. If he knew he had robbed just one store, he would have arrested him, but the officer did not arrest Alex, so he didn't know that he was behind any of the three offenses. "

40,robbery,didn't arrest,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,"Perhaps security cameras were not clear enough to know the identity of the robber, so the officer may not have known it was Alex who was responsible.  If the officer knew Alex was responsible for anything, that is a lousy explanation. The officer would try to arrest Alex, and knowledge of the crime would not factor into Alex not getting arrested."

52,robbery,didn't arrest,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"None of them are good explanations, it says the police officer (not plural) assigned to the cases did not arrest Jacob that day. So they definitely should know who he was from cam footage from the stores, and he should be arrested. Unless by didnt know, you mean that they didn't know he was the suspect, he made a clean get away, they have no suspects, it isn't clear from your wording."
56,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,The officer knew robberies took place but had no idea that Jacob had performed the robberies.

61,robbery,didn't arrest,4,4,3,5,7,5,5,1,"It made sense that the officer didn't make an arrest if he didn't know whether or not Matt committed certain crimes. It made no sense for the officer not to make an arrest if he knew that Matt committed a crime. The more crimes that the officer was not aware of Matt committing, the more reasonable it would be for the officer to not arrest Matt."
62,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,If he didnt suspect Jacob there would be no reason to arrest him. 
73,robbery,didn't arrest,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,1,"As a police oficer, it is quiet easy to catch the robbers. And alex had made three robberies on the same day so it would easy to catch him.It is very bad for the police officer not catching alex."
76,robbery,didn't arrest,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,"I think that if the officer knows and he did not arrest the suspect then that is negligence and is unacceptable. However, not knowing if someone committed a crime may not be that acceptable but can be explained as a lack of communication or lack of quickness in information dissemination and not entirely the officer's fault."

88,robbery,didn't arrest,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,2,He had to make sure he had the full story before any action was taken. 
94,robbery,didn't arrest,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,I felt it was a good explanation if in case the officer didn't know David commited the crimes and a bad explanation if he did know as that seems to be what makes sense to me.

109,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,"If the officer had not known Jacob had done any of the robberies, it made sense he didn't arrest him. If he had known Jacob committed any of the robberies, but didn't arrest him, it could be that the officer couldn't find Jacob."
118,robbery,didn't arrest,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,"The only very good explanation, without further information, is that the officer didn't know he had robbed any of the stores. But it doesn't mean that there's not a good explanation for other answers - he may have been arrested later, or questioned in respect of other offences."
123,robbery,didn't arrest,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,The cop pretty much had no idea as there was probably no evidence.
126,robbery,didn't arrest,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,"It happens very less that even after police officer knowing who did the crime , he doesn't arrest him. It is most probably that police officer didn't knew who did it."

158,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,There's no evidence that the officer knew Alex was involved. The officer would have no reason to arrest Alex without suspicion.

177,robbery,didn't arrest,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,1,The officer should arrest Matt if he knew Matt committed any of the three robberies.  The fact that he didn't know Matt committed robberies at 1 or 2 locations doesn't mean he knew Matt committed the robberies at the remaining locations.  There is not enough information to determine what the officer knew or didn't know on these questions.
179,robbery,didn't arrest,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,1,"If officer comes to know about at least one of the 3 events, he would have arrested Jacob. So. I went with statements close to agreement with this."

Therefore, any combination of locks could be locked, like A is not and B and C are, or the opposite of that.

That would seem to assume that Jacob wanted to use the specific rooms that were locked.

So I assume he knew a door he needed to open was locked."

91,locks,didn't get keys,5,5,5,5,5,5,7,1,He certainly would not have tried to open any without the key unless he thought they were unlocked
92,locks,didn't get keys,2,2,2,5,5,5,7,1,Matt thought that at least one of the locks would be open since the locks are not always locked. 
95,locks,didn't get keys,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,3,Alex may have known that the locks aren't always locked and he wanted to try the door before bothering the secretary.
99,locks,didn't get keys,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,"I assume he was trying to save time by just trying the locks himself. However, if there's 3 locks, there's a decent chance at least one would be locked."

124,locks,didn't get keys,5,5,5,5,5,5,7,1,"It isn't stated that an employee can't open the supply room without first getting the key. If Alex didn't know if any of the locks were locked, I call that a good explanation. The options that don't include all locks are leaning towards a good explanation, but Alex seems to have some information regarding at least one lock, so it'd make sense that they could have gotten the full picture before attempting to open the supply room."

128,locks,didn't get keys,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,1,I think David would know that at least one was locked. He might not have known that one of the doors was locked. It's unlikely that he wouldn't have asked for the keys if he knew the doors were locked.
