Subject,Story,Case,Explanation 0,Explanation 1,Explanation 2,Explanation 3,Explanation 4,Explanation 5,Explanation 6,Explanation 7,Reasoning
1,food allergy,didn't eat,2,7,4,6,4,2,3,5,"Matt knew that the goat cheese contained benzatrate, and that the bell pepper contained benzatrate, and that the bacon contained benzatrate."
4,food allergy,didn't eat,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,1,He should know which foods contain benzatrate and he should always known for a fact whether a food contains it before he eats it.
7,food allergy,didn't eat,6,5,6,5,6,5,6,2,"Jacob knew that goat cheese, bell pepper, and bacon contained benzatrate once he got the results of physical examination from doctor."
8,food allergy,didn't eat,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,Too much of a risk for him
9,food allergy,didn't eat,4,5,3,4,4,4,4,4,I went with my gut feeling on that
13,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"The host knows Jacob and his allergies. In any case, Jacob would have been informed of the foods to avoid."
15,food allergy,didn't eat,5,5,5,5,7,6,7,5,Matt not knowing or knowing fully that the items had benzatrate would be a good reason for him not to eat it. 
16,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Jacob could have known that any one of the three ingredient contained benzatrate or any combination of two or of all three of the ingredients. He may have been a faithful Jew and never had bacon nor would have eaten the dish because of his faith.
18,food allergy,didn't eat,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,Matt may or may not have known that the foods contained benzatrate. He may have simply chosen not to eat these foods. 
19,food allergy,didn't eat,5,4,4,5,3,5,5,5,What way this is my best opinion.
20,food allergy,didn't eat,6,5,7,7,7,7,7,3,Matt must have known that at least the bacon had benzatrate in it because bacon always has stuff added to it. He may has also suspected the cheese and that the pepper had been contaminated 
21,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,"It would make sense for him to avoid the appetizer if he knew it contained his allergen. It would also make sense for him to avoid it if he didn't know, just in case."
22,food allergy,didn't eat,5,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,n/a 
23,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,He might have prior knowledge of what foods contain it due to the fact that he has the allergy.
26,food allergy,didn't eat,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,Because he knew that the food contained benzatrate and he was allergic to it.
27,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"All three ingredients contained benzatrate which means he was allergic to all 3, so any of the foods that he didn't eat provided a good explanation for why he didn't eat the appetizer, as they all would have made him sick. "
29,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,"When he knew the ingredients could hurt him, that is a good reason not to eat the food."
30,food allergy,didn't eat,3,5,6,4,5,5,6,3,"I thought David probably knew what common food items likely contained benzatrate and likely would know about bacon most, green peppers second, and goat cheese last based on his likelihood of encountering such items."
31,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Alex was probably aware that one or all of the items had benzatrate
33,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,3,5,2,7,2,"alex knew goat cheese bell pepper,and bacan contained benzatrate"
34,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,ALEX WANTED TO AVOID EATING FOOD CONTAINING BENZATRATE
36,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,If David was severely allergic to benzatrate he would have prior knowledge of what foods usually if not always contain that food additive.  Most people with food allergies do not eat food they do not prepare or bring with them.  They need to know exactly what it is in it.  David might have asked what was in the the appetizer.
37,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Most people with allergies like these have a pretty good idea of what to stay away from.  My cousin has been allergic to several things his whole life and has known what not to eat since the age of 4 or possibly earlier.
40,food allergy,didn't eat,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,4,"David probably knows what foods have benzatrate. It is possible, though, that he just didn't like any of the foods and accidentally avoided the benzatrate."
41,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,All three of the ingredients contained benzatrate 
44,food allergy,didn't eat,6,5,3,5,4,5,4,3,I think Jacob had some idea
45,food allergy,didn't eat,5,4,4,5,5,5,6,2,"If he knew, then he wouldn't eat it."
46,food allergy,didn't eat,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"If he knew any of them contained the benzatrate than he should not have eaten them.  If he didn't know, than he shouldn't have eaten them in case they did have it."
47,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,If Matt knew that any of the ingredients in the appetizer contained benzatrate then that is a very good explanation as to why he did not eat the appetizer.
48,food allergy,didn't eat,4,6,5,5,6,3,6,4,just looked right
50,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,Jacob knowing that any of the ingredients could harm him is a good explanation for not eating any of them.
51,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,"It's good for him to avoid the food if he knew any ingredient contained benzatrate. But it also makes sense for him to avoid the food if he doesn't know. Since he didn't prepare the food himself and didn't see an ingredient list, he can't assume these foods don't contain benzatrate."
52,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3," If he's allergic to it, it makes sense that he would know, and would avoid it. I guess this scenario you didn't specify that he already knew that he was allergic to it, but it seems odd to me that someone wouldn't know they are allergic to something that is in common foods."
53,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Matt didn't ate the appetizer because he knew it has ingredents that he can't eat
55,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,I believe because Jacob didn't eat the appetizer he knew that all three ingredients contain the thing he is allergic too. 
56,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Alex is aware of her allergic condition and what foods not to eat this is the most logical reason to my answers.
57,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,If Matt was severely allergic he should have known that the foods presented would contain benzatrate.
58,food allergy,didn't eat,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,Anyone severely allergic to anything would be very informed about what to avoid.
60,food allergy,didn't eat,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,knowing is good explanation
61,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"Any of the explanations that note that Alex was aware of the ingredient benzatrate being in the food was a satisfying explanation to me. Because Alex knows that he is allergic to benzatrate, it makes very good sense that he would not eat an appetizer which includes food that is known to contain benzatrate in it."
62,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,"He either actively avoided the food as many people with allergies do, or he just wasnt hungry. "
64,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,Alex would have avoided the appetizer if he'd known that any of it's ingredients contained the benzatrate he's allergic to.
68,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,David probably knows what foods trigger his allergies so he passed on the item as one or more had the ingredient his is allergic to.
71,food allergy,didn't eat,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,Matt either had uncommon knowledge or is really lucky.
72,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,"If you know ANY of the ingredients has something you're severely allergic to, you shouldn't eat it due to the consequences. In the case that he didn't know, it's still an okay explanation. Maybe he just didn't like the food?"
73,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,As Matt has allergic problems to benzatrate and after he knows that the apetizer served at the party has it it will be wise if he avoids those and he rightly did.
74,food allergy,didn't eat,3,6,6,5,5,6,5,5,David conscious about health 
76,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,I think that the fact that he avoided it even if he didn't know is kind of acceptable but should be improved upon but the other instances are perfect as he has knowledge of the contents of each ingredient but he needs to improve this knowledge.
79,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Matt decided not to eat the food because he knew he was allergic to a chemical in the ingredients.
80,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Any explanation where Matt knew the allergen would give an equally valid and strong reason. 
84,food allergy,didn't eat,5,5,5,5,5,5,7,5,"Jason might not have been hungry, or he might have known that all three of the appetizers had benzatrate. He might have been unsure about all of them and he might have wanted to avoid the possibility that they might have the additive."
85,food allergy,didn't eat,5,5,5,5,6,5,6,6,nothing to say
86,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,David knows about his allergy so he must know what foods he can or cannot eat.
87,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,Alex only had to know that one item contained benzatrate because that one item would then be dangerous for him. He didn't have to know anything else.
88,food allergy,didn't eat,5,5,4,4,5,4,5,4,I think Matt did the best he could given what he could reasonably tell 
89,food allergy,didn't eat,6,2,4,5,3,2,5,6,just what sounded best
94,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,It makes sense for him not to eat the appetizer that contained benzatrate in all the ingredients as he was probably well aware. 
96,food allergy,didn't eat,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,alex is probably knowledgeable about what foods potentially contain the additive that he is allergic to
102,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,"Well he knew that the food contained benzatrate, so he didn't eat any of it. It would have been a bad explanation to me if he knew that the food contained benzatrate and he decided to eat it anyway."
103,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Jacob knew that all of the appetizers had benzatrate and he knew he was allergic to it.
106,food allergy,didn't eat,2,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,David probably assumed that bacon had the additive
107,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,"Jacob either knew he was allergic to an ingredient or didn't know whether teh ingredients contained the chemical. Either way, he was being appropriately cautious for his allergy."
108,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,If the only reason to reject the appetizer was the presence of  benzatrate then its presence in any of the components would be a good explanation. Not knowing that the appetizer does not contain benzatrate is also a good explanation for rejecting the appetizer.
109,food allergy,didn't eat,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,1,"If David knew all the food had benzatrate, then not eating any of it makes sense. If he knew only one or two of the foods had benzatrate , then it doesn't explain why he didn't eat the remaining food(s). If he didn't know any of them had benzatrate, then no reason is given for why he didn't eat the foods."
111,food allergy,didn't eat,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,He knew that some contained benzatrate so he erred on the side of caution
116,food allergy,didn't eat,4,1,3,5,6,5,4,3,Just given an explanation based on the information
118,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"it doesn't matter if he knew whether 1,2 or 3 ingredients contained benzatrate - he'd still be severely allergic. The last answer doesn't provide an explanation."
120,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,"If he knew benzatrate was in dish, he wouldn't have eaten it. If he was still weary that those things were in there, I would understand that he would be cautious."
121,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Alex wouldn't eat the food if they knew they contained benzatrate
123,food allergy,didn't eat,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,"When you have allergies you need to know what foods do what, so he knew based on knowledge."
126,food allergy,didn't eat,5,5,5,5,5,6,5,2,"A person who is suffering from some kind of severe allergy has a tendency to know what kind of things could start off symptoms for that allergy, so jacob would have already researched on what foods contain benzatrate."
129,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,"They're all good explanations, even the one where he didn't know. He should eat carefully and with confidence."
137,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,good judgement to avoid the foods 
140,food allergy,didn't eat,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,2,It's an good explanation as to why Jacob didn't eat the appetizer. 
141,food allergy,didn't eat,5,7,6,3,3,2,5,3,Alex thought the food smelled bad
143,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Matt is severely allergic
144,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,3,"If she knew at least one of the ingredients contained benzatrate, that was enough to warrant her not eating the dish."
145,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,If Alex knows that at least one of the ingredients of the appetizer contains the additive that triggers his allergic reaction then he will not eat it.
146,food allergy,didn't eat,5,3,5,4,4,3,5,4,that how it be
147,food allergy,didn't eat,6,3,4,6,7,7,3,5,I went with my guy feeling and what I thought seems to be the best logic.
148,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,"If any one of the ingredients has a chance of containing benzatrate, it's best to stay away from the appetizer altogether in order to avoid an allergic reaction."
150,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,"He could have knew or didn't know for sure, but he didn't want to take a chance."
158,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"Jacob would probably educate himself on benzatrate since he is allergic, it's common, and most other people probably can't tell him what it is found in."
159,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,If he knew it contained it then of course it makes sense.
160,food allergy,didn't eat,5,6,6,5,5,6,5,5,Chances are he knew that he couldn't eat the bell pepper or the bacon. Those are pretty common. He likely knows about goat cheese too but I'm not sure.
161,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"If David knew that any of the ingredients contained benzatrate, that would be a very good explanation for his behavior."
162,food allergy,didn't eat,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,i feel like he would know that these products had these things in it and would avoid them.
163,food allergy,didn't eat,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,"If he's severely allergic, he should know. "
166,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,If David knew any or all of the foods contained the substance he was allergic to it would certainly be a natural explanation as to why he didn't eat any of them. It's also possible he didn't like any of the three foods but I would assume the former explanation would be more accurate.
169,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,it was based on logic
170,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,if he knew he wouldn't eat it
171,food allergy,didn't eat,4,4,5,4,5,6,4,1,"I wasn't sure if he knew or didn't know that the food items contained benzatrate. So, for some of the answers, I gave a rating of ""4."" For some of the other answers, they sounded pretty good as being a good explanation for why he didn't eat the appetizer. So, I gave those a rating of ""5"" or higher. And for the ones that were not good explanations, I gave them lower scores."
172,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,6,6,6,5,2,"Since Jacob is severely allergic to benzatrate, he would probably be aware of what foods contain the additive. It's more likely he'd be aware of the additive in one food than in all three."
174,food allergy,didn't eat,5,6,6,5,5,6,6,2,He knows what food contain the things he is alergic to.
177,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"Since all of the ingredients contained benzatrate, the fact that Jacob knew any 1 of the ingredients contained benzatrate is an excellent reason for him not eating the appetizer."
179,food allergy,didn't eat,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,1,"David won't eat the appetizer if either of the 3 dishes contain benzatrate. So, I went with statements with closeness to this."
180,food allergy,didn't eat,3,3,3,5,5,3,7,7,It is not enough for David to know that one or two appetizers contained benzatrate for him to not eat any appetizer at all. A very good explanation for not eating any appetizer at all would be that David knew or did not know that all three appetizers contained benzatrate because that would explain why he didn't eat any.
182,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,He is allergic and any one of them could have been contaminated with the allergan.
183,food allergy,didn't eat,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,here David knew that he has an allergic to a common food additive called benzatrate. in the party the appetizer served contains benzatrate. so  david didn't eat the appetizer. this is really good decision made by david.
184,food allergy,didn't eat,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,I have no sure way of knowing that David knew.
185,food allergy,didn't eat,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,what does benzatrate even mean? matt didnt explain it
186,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"If he knew about it, obviously he wouldn't eat it."
187,food allergy,didn't eat,4,4,4,5,5,5,7,1,"Since Jacob is allergic to a common food additive, he must have asked if any of the foods contained it. That's what any person who's allergic to anything would most likely do in order to avoid painful consequences. I rated statements containing only one or two products out of three less than 7 because the story involves all three ingredients, so the explanation should ideally mention all three of them."
188,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,Matt would not want to eat any of the three ingredients if he knew that they contained benzatrate.
189,food allergy,didn't eat,6,6,6,3,4,2,3,3,some sentences are redundant 
190,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,"Alex knew that all three ingredients contained benzatrate, so he is right to not eat the appetizer. It is better to be safe than sorry, especially concerning your health"
191,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,Not knowing what an appetizer contains is a good reason to avoid eating it but even more so is it smart to avoid eating one that has ingredients that contain an allergen.  Especially when one can die of eating such an item. 
192,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,He knew that at least one or all contained benzatrate.
193,food allergy,didn't eat,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,"It's easier to tell, because if one of them is there, he can reject the hole appetizer."
0,food allergy,ate,1,1,1,3,3,3,7,1,"It's obvious that Matt knew that whichever ingredient is not mentioned under ""didn't know"" list contains benzatrate. Say, he didn't know about 2 of 3 - maybe he thought that the volume of b. in the ingredient he knew about won't be enough to cause a severe onset of allergy. But if he didn't know about 1 of 3, it means he knew that 2 of 3 for sure contain b., and it's too careless then.to eat that appetizer. "
2,food allergy,ate,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,2,Matt woldn't have consumed the appetiser if he was aware that it contained benzatrate.
3,food allergy,ate,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,1,"If he's allergic to the substance, I think it's imperative for him to know what foods contain it so he doesn't accidentally ingest it."
5,food allergy,ate,1,7,6,6,7,6,7,1,I think if he knew he def would have not at this at all. 
6,food allergy,ate,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,"Alex should have been a little more cautious, but hungry people make mistakes. He should know all foods that contain the chemical he is allergic too or pay the price. "
10,food allergy,ate,3,4,5,5,3,5,4,6,Correct Answers 
11,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"All those reasons were good ones, because any one would have had an effect. EXCEPT the last one. He did not know any contained it."
12,food allergy,ate,4,6,5,5,5,5,4,2,"Matt didn't know that the goat cheese contained benzatrate,and also he don't know that the bacon contained benzatrate and also he didn't know that the bell pepper contained benzatrate."
14,food allergy,ate,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,"I feel like he would know what things he's allergic to, and all of these are pretty common."
17,food allergy,ate,2,2,2,6,2,6,6,6,You want the person to be as descriptive as possible when explaining topics. 
24,food allergy,ate,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,"I rated all of them at 3 because I think that if someone is allergic to something, they should be very aware of what foods contain the ingredient they are allergic too. The only one I rated as 1 was that he knew, that is a very bad explanation because it doesn't make sense for him to eat it if he knows it contains benzatrate."
25,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Alex would not cause himself to get allergies.
28,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"Since he's allergic, the only way he could have eaten the appetizer is by not knowing that it contained benzatrate"
32,food allergy,ate,7,7,5,7,7,5,7,1,if he had known he would not have ate them 
35,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"It is a very good explanation that he didn't know the ingredients in the foods he ate, It is a bad explanation that he knew because he wouldn't have ate it if he knew"
38,food allergy,ate,6,4,1,3,2,2,1,1,if you are allergic to something yo have to know what products contains that additive.
39,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,if he knows hes allergic the only logical explanation is he had no idea the food contained the allergin
42,food allergy,ate,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,"If he's allergic to it, he should know what foods it is in. However, why would he intentionally hurt himself."
43,food allergy,ate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"If this is a common food additive and he is allergic to it, he will know what foods commonly contain this additive.  Ignorance is not a valid excuse when it comes to food allergies."
49,food allergy,ate,5,4,5,6,4,3,5,6,best answerd.
54,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"matt didnt know that the products contain benzatrate, other wise he would not have eaten it."
59,food allergy,ate,2,4,2,4,2,4,2,2,I think it would be very unreasonable for Matt to not know that any of the products aside from bell pepper contain something he is allergic to as they are very common.
63,food allergy,ate,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,Hope he don't know which food contain Benzatrate.
65,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"If he knew at least one contained it, he would not have eaten the appetizer. "
66,food allergy,ate,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,He must be sure of all three to be willing to eat. So only knowing all three was a good explanation
67,food allergy,ate,4,4,4,7,7,7,7,1,He wouldn't have eaten the allergens if he'd known they were there.  It really doesn't matter how you word it.  
69,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"He could have easily not known about all three, but if he KNEW about it, that wouldn't make sense."
70,food allergy,ate,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,"I gave him 4's for when he didn't  know, because he should have asked until he did know so it's not really a good explanation.  I gave him a 1 for when he did know, because he shouldn't have eaten it then."
75,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,It doesn't make any sense that he would eat the appetizer if he knew any of the ingredients contained benzatrate. It makes more sense if he didn't know that any single one of the ingredients contained benzatrate.
77,food allergy,ate,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,All of the explanations seem good.
78,food allergy,ate,5,5,7,4,5,4,1,6,With alex being allergic I feel it's logical to asume he wasn't aware the allergens were in the food. 
81,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"If Jacob knew that these food items contained benzatrate, he would not have eaten them."
82,food allergy,ate,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,"If he is severely allergic he should know all of these things, or should have the common sense to find out before eating."
83,food allergy,ate,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,7,"Well, if he knew that at least one or two things contained the allergy, he's at fault and kind of dumb. But if he didn't know anything that he ate contained it, then that is understandable."
90,food allergy,ate,6,7,6,5,6,6,4,1,I do not think that David knew that bell pepper had the ingredient benzatrate.
91,food allergy,ate,5,5,5,5,5,5,7,1,He would not have eaten it if he had known 
92,food allergy,ate,2,2,2,3,3,3,7,1,Since all of the food items contained benzatrate an explanation would have to contain the fact that all three of them had this additive. Listing just one or two is a bad explanation. 
93,food allergy,ate,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,7,He knows everything correct.
95,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Jacob obviously didn't know that benzatrate was in the appetizer at all.
97,food allergy,ate,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,4,Alex should have asked if the items contained the ingredient her was allergic to . It is sorta his own fault. 
98,food allergy,ate,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,1,Had a severe allergy
99,food allergy,ate,3,3,3,3,3,4,1,1,"If he knows he has this allergy, he needs to be knowledgeable about what foods he's allergic to. All 3 food items contain it, so at least 1 of the 3 should have alerted him that he shouldn't eat the food. In reality, he should know all 3 are allergens."
100,food allergy,ate,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,IT'S AN ALERGIC COMMON FOOD ADDITIVE
101,food allergy,ate,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,7,Jacob know very well that all three items make benzatrate. 
104,food allergy,ate,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,"If David knew that the foods contained benzatrate, it would be a very bad explanation of why he ate the foods. If he didn't know, it would be a good explanation, but he should have asked about the ingredients, or have more knowledge of what types of foods contain the additive."
105,food allergy,ate,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,"Since Alex is severely allergic, Alex would have wanted to avoid benzatrate. The way I see it, Alex wouldn't have known the appetizers contained the additive - that explains the carelessness. "
110,food allergy,ate,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,"I can understand it if he didn't know any of the ingredients had benzatrate, but if he knew even one of them did why would he eat the dish anyway?"
112,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Alex would have only eaten the food not knowing it contained the additive he is allergic to.
113,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Alex didn't know that the ingredients contained benzatrate.
114,food allergy,ate,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,"He had to have not known any of them contained the additive. If he knew one of them did, then he wouldn't take it. "
115,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"If he didn't know the food contained benzatrate, then it's understandable that he would eat it."
117,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,"If he didn't know, then eating it was not a bad idea if he felt like it."
119,food allergy,ate,6,3,4,3,3,4,5,5,I made my judgement off of my gut feeling.
122,food allergy,ate,6,6,6,7,7,7,6,5,very intersting
124,food allergy,ate,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,The only good explanation would be that Jacob wasn't aware of the food additive in the appetizer at all. Picking and choosing implies that he was aware of benzatrate in some of the food.
125,food allergy,ate,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,1,Alex wouldn't eat the appetizers if they had food additives that dangerous to Alex.
127,food allergy,ate,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,David wouldn't have eaten any of them if eh knew they had benzatrate.
128,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,6,6,6,5,1,I think it's unlikely that Jacob didn't know any of them contained benzatrate. It is more likely that he didn't know a couple of the items contained this ingredient. It's very unlikely that he ate it knowing they all contained it.
130,food allergy,ate,4,4,4,4,5,5,4,4,I just did hat
131,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,I figured David would not eat something knowing that he was allergic to it.
132,food allergy,ate,5,3,4,6,2,5,3,6,just my opinions
133,food allergy,ate,5,3,5,4,3,6,4,4,I do not feel that any of them were intentional. 
134,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,I don't think he knew what the ingredients were that was in the appetizer because he ate them. I do not think he would have put himself at risk like that if he had known what was in the appetizers.
135,food allergy,ate,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,1,given that he is severely allergic to bebzatrate I dont think he would knowingly eat an appetizer containing so much of it
136,food allergy,ate,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,1,I'm assupming david didn't know that they were made from benzatrate therefore he ate them.
138,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,He ate the food only because he didn't know any component contained benzatrate.
139,food allergy,ate,7,6,7,6,7,6,6,7,very nice
142,food allergy,ate,5,5,6,5,4,5,4,3,"I think Matt didn't expect for the additive to be in the dip, thus he ate it thinking that benzatrate wasn't in ti."
149,food allergy,ate,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,I think David was not aware that it contains benzatrate
151,food allergy,ate,6,7,6,5,4,5,6,5,i know about that judgements
152,food allergy,ate,5,5,5,6,5,6,6,5,nice
153,food allergy,ate,4,3,4,5,4,4,5,4,Jacob was not aware of the benzatrate in the bacon and goat cheese which I don't think he is responsible for.
154,food allergy,ate,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,He didn't know that all of them contained denzatrate or else he would have not eaten it.  So anything where it says he didn't know is true
155,food allergy,ate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,He knew at least one had benzatrate i all circumstances so no reason to eat it was just
156,food allergy,ate,5,6,6,6,6,5,7,4,Just makes the most sense overall
157,food allergy,ate,7,5,3,6,5,4,5,5,He might have been unaware that all three of any of these items contained the allergen but I would be more convinced that he would be unfamiliar with goat cheese because it is not as common.
164,food allergy,ate,4,5,5,3,5,4,3,4,I think Alex was unaware of what he was doing.
165,food allergy,ate,7,6,7,6,6,6,6,6,nice
167,food allergy,ate,2,2,2,3,3,3,6,1,He should have only eaten it if he didn't know it was in all three items
168,food allergy,ate,4,6,2,2,2,2,2,5,"If he's severely allergic to something I assume he would know most foods that contain that ingredient. Like Bacon. Maybe bell pepper would be something he didn't know, but I'm still skeptical. Those of us with allergies like this KNOW what we can and cannot put into our bodies. "
173,food allergy,ate,6,5,6,5,5,4,5,1,It is likely David did not know what was in the appetizers
175,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,why would he be that stupid if he knew it would cause a reaction unless he was wanting a pitty party
176,food allergy,ate,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,1,The only explanation that works is when matt didn't know all three ingredients contained benzatrate. If he knew of even one it is idiotic for him to eat the appetizer
178,food allergy,ate,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,He didnt know so almost all the sentences make perfect sense
181,food allergy,ate,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"Matt should have known to ask before eating, and when in question don't eat it! "
0,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"Each of these crimes is enough to arrest David, so it doesn't matter whether the officer knows about all three robberies, only two of them, or only one of them."
2,robbery,arrested,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,2,Officer must have assumed that Robert could be only culprit by his experience.
3,robbery,arrested,4,4,4,5,5,5,7,1,The officer would have to have been at one of the places to see at least one of the crimes committed.  I would assume that if he were at more than one venue he would positively conclude that Matt is the serial robber.
5,robbery,arrested,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,It doesn't really ay much here and how the evidence was put together to arrest Matt.

24,robbery,arrested,5,5,5,5,5,5,7,2,"All of them are pretty good explanations because if the officer KNEW that Alex committed any of the robberies, he should be arrested. The only one that doesn't make too much sense is the office arresting him without knowing. "
25,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,The officer should arrest someone if they know they committed the crime.
28,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"It's a small town, it's was easy for the officer to know what stores Matt had robbed."

35,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"The officer knew Alex had robbed a store, I feel that the combination of which stores is all good explanations because he could have knew about one, two or all three but he at least knew one."

39,robbery,arrested,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,if david was arrested its a pretty good bet the police had a good suspicion he committed the robberies. they couldnt be 100% sure but sure enough to arrest him
42,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"He would arrest him because no other crimes were reported that day. So since he hit up all 3 places, it couldn't have been anyone else except him."
43,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,If the officer knew Jacob had committed any one of the crimes that is a very good explanation for his arrest.
49,robbery,arrested,6,5,4,6,4,3,4,5,This is the truth. 
54,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"the officer arrested alex because they knew he had committed a crime, maybe they didn't  about all of them but they knew enough to arrest him"

75,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,He would be arrested for doing any one of those robberies so if the police officer knew he did any of them he could be arrested. He could also be arrested if the police officer assigned to the cases caught him doing anything else illegal so I think the police officer not knowing he committed those robberies is also a valid explanation.
77,robbery,arrested,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,All of the explanations seem good.
78,robbery,arrested,3,4,4,4,3,4,2,1,The officer knew that jacob committed a crime and robbed something therfore arrested him.
81,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"The case states Alex committed 3 robberies.  If the police didn't know that Alex robbed the stores, he would not have arrested him. "

91,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,As long as the officer knew he robbed any one of the places there was reason to arrest

98,robbery,arrested,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,No way to know
99,robbery,arrested,6,6,5,7,7,6,7,1,Knowing that Alex had robbed at least 1 store is a good explanation for arresting him. Knowing multiple or all 3 is a very good reason.
100,robbery,arrested,5,6,6,7,6,4,5,5,POLICE ARRESTED IS GOOD THING TO A TOWN IT SATISFIES ALL OVER THE AREA
101,robbery,arrested,3,2,3,3,4,2,7,1,The police officer know that the Mat is robber person 
104,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"If the officer knew and had evidence of Alex committing the crimes, then those were very good explanations. If the officer didn't know or had no evidence, then it was a very bad explanation."
105,robbery,arrested,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,"Although it's a small town, I can't see how convinced the officer was about Matt being the robber. The way I see it, he was probably suspicious of Matt and took him in for questioning. "
110,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"If the officer knew that Alex had robbed a store then yes, Alex should be arrested. However, if the officer didn't know, I don't feel that Alex should be arrested in that case."

114,robbery,arrested,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,"The officer had to know he robbed one of them, so the more he knew, the more satisfying the explanation would be."
115,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,The officer would've had to known that he robbed any of those stores to justify an arrest.

124,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"In every case where the officer knew that Matt had committed a crime it is a very good explanation for arrest. In the option where the officer isn't aware of the robberies being committed by Matt there could still be another reason for his arrest, but it isn't a good explanation. "
125,robbery,arrested,4,4,4,6,6,5,7,1,The officer knew about all the crimes he committed.
127,robbery,arrested,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,If he was arrested he must have known that he did all or one of those things.
128,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,I think it makes sense that Matt would be arrested if the office knew he had robbed any of the businesses. He would not have been arrested if the officer didn't know he had committed any robberies.
130,robbery,arrested,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,4,I just chose those
131,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,The officer would not have arrested Matt with out evidence.
132,robbery,arrested,2,5,3,6,4,3,5,3,"again, my opinion"
133,robbery,arrested,3,4,6,5,5,4,5,6,I feel it is important to hold people accountable.
134,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,They obviously had video footage or some other type of evidence that pointed towards Jacob and so the officer did his job by arresting Jacob.
135,robbery,arrested,6,6,5,7,7,6,7,1,the police were obviously aware of some or all of his crimes that is why he got arrested 
136,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,The officer knew that Alex committed the three robberies. Very tricky these ones are.
138,robbery,arrested,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,"The officer shouldn't know, but rather suspect, that he robbed the places since he should be innocent until proven guilty."
139,robbery,arrested,6,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,very intersting
142,robbery,arrested,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,7,"It didn't state who the police officer thought had robbed the stores, so maybe they got video footage and could see who robbed the stores."
149,robbery,arrested,2,4,4,5,3,6,5,6,I think the officer was aware of the robberies done by Matt.
151,robbery,arrested,7,6,5,7,5,6,7,6,i just choose on my own decision
152,robbery,arrested,5,5,6,6,5,6,6,5,very nice
153,robbery,arrested,5,4,5,4,4,4,5,3,I think it is justified that David should be arrested for his robberies.
154,robbery,arrested,3,4,4,4,3,4,4,1,"On this one, the officer knows that he did ONE of the crimes.  He may know that he did all of the crimes, but to arrest Matt, he only needs to know about one of them.  So it's possible he knows of the others but not 100% sure."
155,robbery,arrested,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,2,The more reason the police had makes it a better reason to arrest him
156,robbery,arrested,4,5,6,7,5,4,6,6,This made sense to me and how I felt.
157,robbery,arrested,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,I think the fact that the officer knew he robbed at least one of the places is enough to lead to arrest and satisfactory explanation.
164,robbery,arrested,5,6,3,3,5,4,4,4,I feel like Matt deserves what was coming to him.
165,robbery,arrested,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,good
167,robbery,arrested,4,4,5,5,5,5,6,1,Knowing he committed all three robberies is the best explanation for arresting him
168,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,If the officer knew Matt had robbed any one of the places that is an excellent reason to arrest him. 
173,robbery,arrested,4,5,4,4,5,4,5,4,I think that if the police knew he had robbed more than one place it is likely he robbed all three. 
175,robbery,arrested,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,he knew he robbed something one or all does not matter when arresting
176,robbery,arrested,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,1,"If the officer new that david committed either just one or all three robberies, the arrest was justified and a good enough explanation. If the officer didn't know about the robberies, then the arrest makes zero sense."
178,robbery,arrested,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,2,It can be assumed he may have known.. but he could also just be a suspect at this point too
181,robbery,arrested,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"it doesn't mention anything about ""how"" the officer knew "
1,robbery,didn't arrest,5,6,6,6,3,3,4,3,"The officer didn't know that David had robbed the liquor store, or the drug store, or the grocery store."
4,robbery,didn't arrest,5,5,7,6,6,6,7,1,Unless the police officer is corrupt or heavily biased the only likely reason he did not arrest Matt would be if he wasn't aware that Matt had committed any crimes.
7,robbery,didn't arrest,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,I think this is a racial profiling.
8,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,The officer didn't know what he did
9,robbery,didn't arrest,3,4,5,4,4,5,4,4,"I just guessed on this one, I have no idea who knew what."
13,robbery,didn't arrest,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,There is no mention of any proof. So the police had to wait for the next day to gather the evidence before arresting him.
15,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,The police officer would only arrest Alex if they knew for a fact that he robbed these places and them not knowing for certain would be a reason why he wasn't arrested.
16,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"The police could easily have not known that Matt any one or more of the robberies and that does not imply anything about what they knew about the other robberies.  Even if they knew that he committed one or more of them, they may not have had enough evidence to arrest him."
18,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"Since Jacob was not arrested, the office must not have seen sufficient evidence for him to believe that Jacob had committed the crime. "
19,robbery,didn't arrest,5,4,5,5,4,5,5,6,David is a brilliant so police cannot find him. 
20,robbery,didn't arrest,3,5,3,5,5,5,5,3,"I do not think Jacob was arrested because the officer was not sure yet who had robbed the places, he was probably looking into it before he made an arrest . That is a lot of places to rob in one day, maybe he thought a few people had done it. "
21,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,If he didn't know then he would have no reason to arrest him.
22,robbery,didn't arrest,7,6,6,7,6,5,6,7,thank you
23,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"If the officer didn't know, he doesn't have a suspect to arrest."
26,robbery,didn't arrest,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,Because if he did not know who did it then he can not arrest anyone.
27,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"Since Alex was not arrested and all three robberies are arrestable offenses, I would say that the officer didn't know that he had solved any of the three stores. If he knew he had robbed just one store, he would have arrested him, but the officer did not arrest Alex, so he didn't know that he was behind any of the three offenses. "
29,robbery,didn't arrest,4,4,4,4,7,4,7,1,"When the officer didn't know David had robbed any store, that is the only good explanation for not arresting him."
30,robbery,didn't arrest,5,5,5,6,6,7,7,1,Only including the officer not knowing about one or two of the stores being robbed isn't as satisfactory as saying the officer didn't know he had robbed all three of the stores. The other explanations are incomplete.
31,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,The police probably needed to investigate the robberies and look for evidence before making an arrest.
33,robbery,didn't arrest,5,5,5,5,5,1,7,1,the police officer didn't know jacob robbed the three rabberies 
34,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"IF THE OFFICER WAS UNAWARE THAT DAVE HAD COMMITTED THE ROBBERIES, HE WAS NOT OBLIGATED TO MAKE AN ARREST."
36,robbery,didn't arrest,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,The police may or may not have known if Jacob had robbed each store.  They may have had evidence that he had robbed on of the stores but not all of them.  They may have known that he had robbed all of them.  They may have needed to wait for more evidence to be sent off to the crime lab before arresting Jacob.  They may have needed to get a warrant from the Judge to search his property or to arrest him.  There just isn't enough information.
37,robbery,didn't arrest,5,5,5,5,5,6,7,1,It is likely the officer did not know that David had robbed anything.
40,robbery,didn't arrest,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,"Perhaps security cameras were not clear enough to know the identity of the robber, so the officer may not have known it was Alex who was responsible.  If the officer knew Alex was responsible for anything, that is a lousy explanation. The officer would try to arrest Alex, and knowledge of the crime would not factor into Alex not getting arrested."
41,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,the officer didn't know yet 
44,robbery,didn't arrest,3,4,6,6,5,5,3,4,Seemed like the best choice
45,robbery,didn't arrest,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,1,If he didn't know then he didn't arrest him.
46,robbery,didn't arrest,6,2,2,6,6,2,6,2,"If he didn't know that David had robbed any of the stores that was a good explanation, but if he knew he had robbed any of them that would've been a bad explanation"
47,robbery,didn't arrest,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,1,If the police officer knew that he had robbed any of the stores then any explanation stating that he did not know of the other robberies is not a good explanation for not arresting him for one of teh robberies.
48,robbery,didn't arrest,6,3,6,5,4,2,3,2,looked right 
50,robbery,didn't arrest,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,1,"The only reason the officer wouldn't arrest him is if he didn't know about ALL of the robberies.  If he knew about even one robbery, he should still arrest him."
51,robbery,didn't arrest,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,1,The officer not arresting David when he knew he robbed any of the stores is not a good explanation. He should have arrested him if he knew David robbed even 1 of the stores.
52,robbery,didn't arrest,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"None of them are good explanations, it says the police officer (not plural) assigned to the cases did not arrest Jacob that day. So they definitely should know who he was from cam footage from the stores, and he should be arrested. Unless by didnt know, you mean that they didn't know he was the suspect, he made a clean get away, they have no suspects, it isn't clear from your wording."
53,robbery,didn't arrest,1,5,1,3,3,6,6,1,the officer din't know that Alex committed three robberies that day

57,robbery,didn't arrest,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,1,If the officer did not know he robbed any stores he is not to blame for not arresting him. 
58,robbery,didn't arrest,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,1,I doubt they'd not arrest him if the police knew
60,robbery,didn't arrest,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,1,need suspicion for arreest
61,robbery,didn't arrest,4,4,3,5,7,5,5,1,"It made sense that the officer didn't make an arrest if he didn't know whether or not Matt committed certain crimes. It made no sense for the officer not to make an arrest if he knew that Matt committed a crime. The more crimes that the officer was not aware of Matt committing, the more reasonable it would be for the officer to not arrest Matt."
62,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,If he didnt suspect Jacob there would be no reason to arrest him. 
64,robbery,didn't arrest,7,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,The officer would be expected to arrest him if the officer knew he'd robbed any one (or more) of the places that had been robbed.
68,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,Since no robberies were reported the police officer would not have had reason to arrest Jacob.
71,robbery,didn't arrest,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,2,The officer didnt know he specifically had done something
72,robbery,didn't arrest,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,"There's no reason to not arrest David, unless the officer didn't know he robbed any of the stores at all. Robbing one store should mean an arrest."
73,robbery,didn't arrest,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,1,"As a police oficer, it is quiet easy to catch the robbers. And alex had made three robberies on the same day so it would easy to catch him.It is very bad for the police officer not catching alex."
74,robbery,didn't arrest,4,4,3,6,5,6,5,5,not good at his work
76,robbery,didn't arrest,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,"I think that if the officer knows and he did not arrest the suspect then that is negligence and is unacceptable. However, not knowing if someone committed a crime may not be that acceptable but can be explained as a lack of communication or lack of quickness in information dissemination and not entirely the officer's fault."
79,robbery,didn't arrest,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,"Unless the officer didn't know about any of the robberies, he'd arrest the suspect."
80,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,If the officer did not know Alex committed a crime he would not have arrested him so any of the options are valid. 
84,robbery,didn't arrest,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,"If the officer had known that Alex had robbed even one store, he would have been arrested that day. Therefore, the officer must not have known that Alex had robbed any stores."
85,robbery,didn't arrest,5,6,5,6,5,4,6,5,nothing to say
86,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,The police officer did not know yet if Matt was the person who robbed the stores. 
87,robbery,didn't arrest,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,1,"If the officer knew Matt had robbed those three places, that is a bad explanation. If the officer did not know he had robbed any of the stores, that is a very good explanation. The other explanations are not complete."
88,robbery,didn't arrest,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,2,He had to make sure he had the full story before any action was taken. 
89,robbery,didn't arrest,6,2,4,4,3,4,6,5,Just what sounded reasonable
94,robbery,didn't arrest,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,I felt it was a good explanation if in case the officer didn't know David commited the crimes and a bad explanation if he did know as that seems to be what makes sense to me. 
96,robbery,didn't arrest,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,the police officer doesn't know who committed the robberies
102,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,If the office knew he robbed any of them then that would have been a bad explanation to me.
103,robbery,didn't arrest,1,7,7,1,1,1,7,1,The officer didn't know Alex committed any crimes that day so he didn't arrest him.
106,robbery,didn't arrest,6,7,6,6,6,6,6,2,"If he wasn't arrested, it was probably because the cop didn't know it was him."
107,robbery,didn't arrest,7,5,3,7,7,3,7,3,"It's possible that the drug store and grocery store thefts were related to need, while the liquor store was almost certainly not."
108,robbery,didn't arrest,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,1,"The only good explanation is not knowing who committed any of the crimes. Not knowing who committed one or two of the crimes leaves open the possibility that the officer knew who committed the other crime or crimes, though he might not have known. There is not enough information to make a judgement. Knowing that David committed at least one of the crimes is a very bad explanation for not making an arrest."
109,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,"If the officer had not known Jacob had done any of the robberies, it made sense he didn't arrest him. If he had known Jacob committed any of the robberies, but didn't arrest him, it could be that the officer couldn't find Jacob."
111,robbery,didn't arrest,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,He did not know who comitted the three crimes aka robberies
116,robbery,didn't arrest,7,6,6,6,7,7,7,5,The officer was not aware that he was the robber
118,robbery,didn't arrest,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,"The only very good explanation, without further information, is that the officer didn't know he had robbed any of the stores. But it doesn't mean that there's not a good explanation for other answers - he may have been arrested later, or questioned in respect of other offences."
120,robbery,didn't arrest,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,"If he knew, he should have arrested him. If he didn't, he didn't."
121,robbery,didn't arrest,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,"The officer knew that Matt had robbed those places because he was assigned to the case, therefore none of the explanations are satisfying."
123,robbery,didn't arrest,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,The cop pretty much had no idea as there was probably no evidence.
126,robbery,didn't arrest,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,"It happens very less that even after police officer knowing who did the crime , he doesn't arrest him. It is most probably that police officer didn't knew who did it."
129,robbery,didn't arrest,2,3,2,3,2,3,7,1,The only good explanation is that the officer didn't know he robbed all 3. Varying degrees of badness for everything but that.
137,robbery,didn't arrest,3,3,3,4,4,2,7,1,If he didnt know then that is understandable but if he knew of even one of the robbies there is no reason he shouldnt have been arrested that day
140,robbery,didn't arrest,4,3,5,3,3,5,4,5,It made the most sense. 
141,robbery,didn't arrest,7,6,6,3,5,3,7,4,The officers liked David

147,robbery,didn't arrest,6,4,5,3,7,7,6,5,I went by what would be a good explanation of things and seems to cover it.
148,robbery,didn't arrest,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,1,"The only acceptable answer is the the officer didn't know Jacob had robbed any of the three places. If the officer didn't know about one or two of the robberies, there is still a chance that he knew about SOME of the robberies."
150,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,The officer can't arrest Matt if he isn't sure if he committed the crimes
158,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,There's no evidence that the officer knew Alex was involved. The officer would have no reason to arrest Alex without suspicion.
159,robbery,didn't arrest,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,If the cop knew he did he should have arrested him
160,robbery,didn't arrest,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,"The officer probably couldn't find jacob. He might not have known, but even if he did Jacob could have been hiding."
161,robbery,didn't arrest,1,7,1,1,1,1,7,1,"If the officer didn't know that Matt had committed any robberies, that is a very good explanation. If the officer knew Matt committed any robberies that is a very bad explanation."
162,robbery,didn't arrest,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,the police officer must not have known that it was him or else he would have been arrested.
163,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,"If the officer knew, then Alex would most likely be arrested. "
166,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,It would be pretty basic that if the officer didn't know Matt had committed any or all of the robberies he would not arrest him. The officer may also not have been aware that the three robberies were committed by the same person.
169,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,it was based on my interpretation of the text
170,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,if he didn't know he'd have no reason to arrest him
171,robbery,didn't arrest,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,1,"For the explanations that sounded good, I gave them high ratings and for the ones that sounded bad, I gave them low ratings."
172,robbery,didn't arrest,2,6,6,7,7,7,7,1,It would make sense for the officer not to arrest Alex if he didn't know for sure he had robbed any one of the businesses.
174,robbery,didn't arrest,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,It never said the officer found someone who robbed the stores.
177,robbery,didn't arrest,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,1,The officer should arrest Matt if he knew Matt committed any of the three robberies.  The fact that he didn't know Matt committed robberies at 1 or 2 locations doesn't mean he knew Matt committed the robberies at the remaining locations.  There is not enough information to determine what the officer knew or didn't know on these questions.
179,robbery,didn't arrest,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,1,"If officer comes to know about at least one of the 3 events, he would have arrested Jacob. So. I went with statements close to agreement with this."
180,robbery,didn't arrest,2,2,2,3,2,3,6,1,"If the officer didn't know that Jacob robbed one store, then it seems to follow that he knew that he robbed one of the others and therefore could have arrested Jacob for those robberies that took place."
182,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,"If the officer didn't know that Jacob had done those things, he isn't going to arrest him. It didn't state as to whether he was aware he had done one and not the others on certain questions."
183,robbery,didn't arrest,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,6,the police officer must arrest the alex that day. once the crime is committed it is duty of the police officer to find out the culprit and arrest him immediately without any hesitations.
184,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,The officer didn't lock him up so he couldn't have known Jacob committed those crimes.
185,robbery,didn't arrest,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,makes sense
186,robbery,didn't arrest,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,Obviously you can't arrest someone if you don't have any kind of reasonable suspcision.
187,robbery,didn't arrest,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,1,"Since the police officer is supposed to arrest someone who commits a crime, the fact that nobody was arrested means that the officer did not know who committed any of the crimes. If he knew who committed any of them, he'd have Alex arrested."
188,robbery,didn't arrest,7,5,5,5,5,5,7,1,"The officer would not have let Jacob go if he knew about any of the robberies. Therefore, he must not have known that Jacob robbed any of the three locations."
189,robbery,didn't arrest,6,7,6,3,3,2,2,3,some sound confusing
190,robbery,didn't arrest,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,1,"If the officer knew David robbed even one of those stores, they should have arrested David. Any explanations are not valid unless they didn't know he robbed any of the stores."
191,robbery,didn't arrest,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,Not knowing whom was responsible is a good explanation for not arresting someone as in the USA arresting someone without having all the evidence can lead to serious consequences.  Also knowing whom did what had me think it was not too bad on not arresting right away as knowing the perpetrator can make it easier to find and arrest them..
192,robbery,didn't arrest,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,1,"If the offer had connected Alex to any robbery he would have been arrested, so either the officer doesn't know that he robbed any store or he doesn't have evidence to say it was him without a doubt."
193,robbery,didn't arrest,5,5,5,6,5,5,6,5,"This one is tougher. The officer didn't know one, but how about the other robberies? Hard to tell if he is telling a good explanation, but in my opinion, most of the explanations are fair."

7,locks,got keys,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,5,"I think that Alex didn't know that Lock A was locked, or that Lock B was locked, or that Lock C was locked. Alex took all the keys in case there is a door or two doors locked for saving the time. "

15,locks,got keys,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,None of the explanations are good because the chances of the locks being locked are unknown.
16,locks,got keys,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,"Knowing something about certain locks means that he may or may not have known the status of the other locks, so it is rational to get all of the keys.  Also, he may need to lock all locks when he leaves so he would need all of the keys."

27,locks,got keys,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,"It's really hard to call this one because even though it has 3 locks, they don't necessarily have to be in ABC order and it says that the locks are not always all locked. Therefore, any combination of locks could be locked, like A is not and B and C are, or the opposite of that. So it's really hard to tell which ones he would get first to open the door, unless he wanted to just get them all to have them and be on the safe side."
29,locks,got keys,4,4,4,5,6,5,7,6,"The more locks he didn't know were locked, the better the reason for him to get all the keys."
30,locks,got keys,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,"I think Jacob got the keys because he didn't know whether any particular locks would be locked or not, not because he knew for sure that any particular ones of them were locked."
31,locks,got keys,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,Matt is probably familiar with how the locks work and that they are sometimes locked.

34,locks,got keys,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,MATT KNEW THAT THE DOORS WHERE LOCKED SO HE HAD TO GET THE KEYS FIRST.
36,locks,got keys,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,Matt did not know if the locks were locked or not.  He might have had prior knowledge but I wasn't given that information.  I would guess that he went and got the keys so that he would not have to walk back to the other building in case the locks were locked.  That way he would already by prepared to open the door.
37,locks,got keys,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,7,It is mostly likely that Alex counted on at least one of the locks being locked.
40,locks,got keys,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,3,"Jacob knowing that any combination of doors were locked seems like a good explanation. That would seem to assume that Jacob wanted to use the specific rooms that were locked.  If Jacob did not know which rooms were locked, then it would seem to be a waste of time to go to the secretary in a separate building and ask for the keys. So I assume he knew a door he needed to open was locked."
