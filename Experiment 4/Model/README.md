Experiment 2B model code
========================

Note: This code runs in Python 3.

* `Main.py`: This file generates predictions for the model.

There are files in the `predictions` folder:
* `predictions.csv`: A human-readable version model predictions
* `*_predictions_tidy`: A tidy version of the model predictions suitable for data analysis

Note that this code is identical to the Experiment 2A simplicity-only model.
