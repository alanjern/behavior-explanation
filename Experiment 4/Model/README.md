Experiment 4 model code
========================

This code runs on Python 3.

* `Main.py`: This file generates predictions for the model.

There are files in the `predictions` folder:
* `predictions.csv`: A human-readable version model predictions
* `*_predictions_tidy`: A tidy version of the model predictions suitable for data analysis

Note that this code is identical to the Experiment 3 simplicity-only model.
