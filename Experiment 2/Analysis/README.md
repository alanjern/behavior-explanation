Experiment 1B analysis code
===========================

* `analyzedata.R`: This file analyzes the data for Experiment 1B. It computes the Cohen's kappa values reported in the paper. It then generates the plots comparing the top N predicted explanations to the proportion of times subjects generated them.
* `bestfitting_modelpredictions.csv`: This file contains the best-fitting model predictions, computed and generated using the `../../Experiment 1A/Analysis/analyzedata.R` script. This file is used by `analyzedata.R` to determine the top N predicted explanations for each model.
