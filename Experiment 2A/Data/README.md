## Note

In the raw data files, the Section column for each subject identifies the section that the person was sitting in for that subject. Because the specific section numbers were flipped about the center axis half of the time (e.g. the Section 1 condition appeared as Section 5 sometimes) these numbers do not always match the section numbers in the three header rows. These numbers are here only to show exactly what subjects saw.
