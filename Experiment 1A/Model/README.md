Experiment 1A model code
========================

Code tested and run in Python 3.

* `model.py`: Generates predictions for all models except the non-probabilistic model.
* `nonprob_model.py`: Generates predictions for the non-probabilistic model.

Note that the predictions generated by these scripts are not the final predictions that appear in the paper. Some post-processing is done by `analyzedata.R` in the Analysis directory to obtain the best-fitting model parameters.

* `*_predictions.csv`: Model predictions presented in the main text.
* `*_predictions_lucechoicerule.csv`: Model predictions using the Luce choice rule as the decision function, as described in the Appendix.
* `*_predictions_lucechoicerule_negutils.csv`: Model predictions using the Luce choice rule and the alternative utility function that allows for negative utilities, as described in the Appendix.
