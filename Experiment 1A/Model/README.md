Experiment 1A model code
========================

Code tested and run in Python 3.

* `model.py`: Generates predictions for all models except the non-probabilistic model. 
* `nonprob_model.py`: Generates predictions for the non-probabilistic model.

Note that these predictions are not the final predictions that appear in the paper. Some post-processing is done by `analyzedata.R` to obtain the best-fitting model parameters first.
