Experiment 1A model code
========================

Code tested and run in Python 3.

TODO: Maybe explain what the main variables are at the end of the file and what the main files are. Need to explain that these are not the model predictions in the figures. Some post-processing happens that is explained in the text and happens in the R analysis script
